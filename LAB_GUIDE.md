1. Make sure you have `node.js`, `yarn` and `git` installed.
1. Clone this git repository: TODO 
1. Open the `labs` folder in the IDE of your choice.
1. To test if everything is up and running, navigate to the labs-day1/lab1 folder and run `yarn && yarn serve`. A website should get started on the localhost:8080 (it may be a different port though, you will see the correct link in the command line).
